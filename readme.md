# Knockout.Unobtrusive

Unobtrusive model binding syntax for [KnockoutJS] (http://knockoutjs.com)

## Getting Started

Knockout.Unobtrusive is all about moving your binding syntax from HTML into your JavaScript. If you like the declarative "data-bind" syntax of Knockout, and see no reason to muck with it, this plugin is probably not for you. No worries, my feelings won't be hurt.

If, however, the phrase "Unobtrusive JavaScript" is something of a personal mission for you, welcome to Knockout.Unobtrusive, a simple plugin that allows you to use the best JavaScript MVVM library around with script-based binding definitions. 

Getting started is simple. Just download [KnockoutJS] (http://knockoutjs.com) and this plugin and include the following script references in your page.

````
<script src="knockout-1.2.1.js"></script>
<script src="knockout.unobtrusive.js"></script>
````

## Prerequisites

* KnockoutJs v1.2.1 or higher

This is a plugin for KnockoutJS and is built and tested against Knockout v1.2.1. If you experience any issues in working with this plugin in your applications, or notice a breaking change to a future version of Knockout that affects this plugin, please let me know on the [Issues tab] (https://github.com/bsatrom/Knockout.Unobtrusive/issues) of this project.

## It's Early Yet...

Knockout.Unobtrusive is still in the early stages of development, and I don't claim to fully support every conceivable scenario for which you might use it. I'm open to both pull requests and issue reports, so feel free to contribute to either.
